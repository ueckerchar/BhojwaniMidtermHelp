'''Create two class definitions

1) a Play class that has attributes for
id, name, number of seats, date and status. Set the value of
the status attribute to True as default. Create an accessor
method each for the name, seats and status attributes only. 
Create a method called 'seats_left' that will reduce the 
number of seats by 1 every time it is called.
Create a mutator method called 'set_status' that will
change the status attribute to False.

2) a Booking class that has attributes for customer name and
seat number. Create accessor methods for both attributes.'''
